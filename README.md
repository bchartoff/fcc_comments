Just the xml parser for the fcc comment dump, does very little (parses out by city/state/zip)

The xml data files aren't pushed here but can be found [on fcc.gov](http://www.fcc.gov/files/ecfs/14-28/ecfs-files.htm)

##NOTE: NOT COMPLETE DATA##

The location parsing only grabs records w/ a city/state/zip (submitted through the online form)

Records such as example_record.xml contain thousands of comments submitted through email, fax, etc.
